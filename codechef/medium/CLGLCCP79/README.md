## Problem

### Worked Example - Performing Subtraction in C

In this example, we demonstrate how to define integers, perform a basic subtraction, store the result in a variable, and then print the output. The subtraction operator (`-`) is used to find the difference between two values.

 **When executed, the code will show:** 

```
Difference: 22

```

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h> 

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize two integer variables
    int number1 = 56;  // First number
    int number2 = 34;  // Second number

    // Subtract number2 from number1 and store the result in 'sum'
    int sum = number1 - number2;

    // Print the result using printf
    printf("Difference: %d", sum);  

    return 0;
}
```

## Problem

### Sensor Data Cleaning

You are tasked with cleaning up data from a faulty sensor. The sensor provides 12 integer readings, but sometimes it produces wrong negative values. Your job is to write a program that reads these 12 values into an array, replaces every negative number with 0, and then prints the corrected array. This process is a simple form of data cleaning, ensuring all readings are non-negative.

### Input Format
- A single line containing 12 space-separated integers.
### Output Format
- A single line containing the 12 corrected integers, separated by spaces.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
10 -5 8 0 -12 22 4 -1 99 1 -7 5
```

```
10 0 8 0 0 22 4 0 99 1 0 5
```

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int readings[12];
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &readings[i]);
        if(readings[i]<0)
        {
        readings[i]=0;
        }
    }

    
    for (i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
        printf("%d ", readings[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
